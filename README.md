# Data-Science-Web-App-with-Streamlit-and-Python
This is a data driven web- dashboard which provides an interactive view of the NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Dataset. I used Streamlit as it was really helpful in visualizing different cases like:
1. Areas where most people were injured
2. During a given time of the day(on hourly basis), what was the number of poeple injured?
3. A histogram plotting of hourly number of crashes by minutes
4. Top 5 affected streets for each type of drivers: Cyclists, Motorists and Pedestrians
